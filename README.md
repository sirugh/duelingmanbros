# DUELING MAN-BROS (Game Jam 2017)

The theme of this year's game jam is "An Unconventional Weapon".

Our concept evolved as a mashup of guitar hero, where each player uses music to
damage their opponents.

## Notes from the brainstorm
```
music game where music is the weapon (guitar hero style)
 - controllers could be sheet music or fret board or piano
 - guitar hero style
 - pattern appears on screen, have to quickly match
 - have to match pattern otherwise disqualified (planet explode)
 - dueling banjos!
 - yodelers on a mountain using their voices to cause avalanches
 - simon says style
```
